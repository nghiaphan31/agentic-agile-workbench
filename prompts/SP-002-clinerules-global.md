# PROTOCOL le workbench — MANDATORY DIRECTIVES (ALL SESSIONS, ALL MODES)




## RULE 1 : MANDATORY READ AT THE START OF EACH SESSION



Before any action, you MUST execute the following sequence in this exact order:




1. CHECK : Does memory-bank/activeContext.md exist?


   - If NO → proceed to the CREATE step


   - If YES → proceed to the READ step


2. CREATE (if absent) : Immediately create memory-bank/activeContext.md AND memory-bank/progress.md


   using the templates defined at the bottom of this file.


3. READ : Read memory-bank/hot-context/activeContext.md then memory-bank/hot-context/progress.md


4. ACT : Process the user’s request




This CHECK→CREATE→READ→ACT sequence is NON-NEGOTIABLE and applies to ALL sessions.




## RULE 2 : MANDATORY WRITE AT THE CLOSE OF EACH TASK



Before closing any task (before attempt_completion), you MUST update:


1. memory-bank/activeContext.md  (new state, next action)


2. memory-bank/progress.md       (check off completed features)




If an architecture decision was made during the session:


3. memory-bank/decisionLog.md    (ADR with date, context, decision, consequences)




## RULE 3 : CONTEXTUAL READ BASED ON THE TASK



- Before modifying the architecture: read memory-bank/systemPatterns.md


- Before executing build/test commands: read memory-bank/techContext.md


- At the start of a sprint or new feature: read memory-bank/productContext.md




## RULE 4 : NO EXCEPTIONS TO RULES 1-3



These rules apply to ALL modes and ALL sessions, without exception.




## RULE 5 : MANDATORY AND SELF-CONTAINED GIT VERSIONING



This rule applies to all modes with access to the terminal (developer, scrum-master).




### 5.1 — What MUST be versioned



EVERYTHING must be versioned under Git, without exception:


- Application source code (src/, app/, etc.)


- System scripts (proxy.py, scripts/start-proxy.ps1, etc.)


- Configuration files (Modelfile, .roomodes, .clinerules, requirements.txt)


- The Memory Bank (memory-bank/*.md)


- System prompts (prompts/SP-*.md and prompts/README.md)


- Plans and architecture documents (plans/ and workbench/*.md)


- QA reports (docs/qa/*.md)


- Canonical documentation (docs/releases/*/ and docs/DOC-*-CURRENT.md)


- The workbench template (template/)


- Git hooks (.githooks/)


- Git attributes and configuration (.gitattributes, .gitignore)




### 5.2 — When to commit



You MUST execute a Git commit in the following situations:


- After creating or modifying a code file


- After updating the Memory Bank


- After modifying .roomodes, .clinerules, Modelfile or any file in prompts/


- After modifying proxy.py or any other script


- Before closing a task (before attempt_completion)




### 5.3 — Commit message format (Conventional Commits)



You MUST use the Conventional Commits format:


- feat(scope): description     -> New feature


- fix(scope): description      -> Bug fix


- docs(memory): description    -> Memory Bank update


- docs(plans): description     -> Documentation update


- chore(config): description   -> Configuration change


- chore(prompts): description  -> System prompt modification


- refactor(scope): description -> Refactoring without functional change


- test(scope): description     -> Adding or modifying tests




### 5.4 — Git commands to use


  git add .


  git commit -m "type(scope): description concise"


### 5.5 — What must NOT be versioned



- The venv/ folder (local Python environment)


- .env files (API keys — NEVER in Git)


- __pycache__/ files and *.pyc


- Logs (*.log)




## RULE 6 : PROMPT REGISTRY CONSISTENCY



This rule applies to developer and scrum-master modes.




### 6.1 — Before any commit touching an artifact linked to a prompt



If you modify one of the following files: proxy.py, .roomodes, .clinerules, Modelfile


you MUST check whether the change impacts a system prompt in prompts/.




### 6.2 — Verification procedure



1. Read prompts/README.md to identify the affected prompt


2. Open the corresponding SP-XXX file in prompts/


3. If the prompt content must change: modify SP-XXX, increment its version


4. If SP-007 (Gem Gemini) is impacted: add a warning in the commit:


   "MANUAL DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED: update the Gem Gemini with SP-007"


5. Include the modified prompts/ files in the same commit as the target files

   **File concatenation:** Never use PowerShell for file concatenation. The pattern `(Get-Content a) + (Get-Content b) | Set-Content out` silently produces a 1-line file with exit code 0 — no error is raised. Use Python instead (see `scripts/rebuild_sp002.py` for the canonical implementation).

   **SP-002 (.clinerules sync):** Use `python scripts/rebuild_sp002.py` — the SP-002 code block must always match `.clinerules` byte-for-byte. Always verify with `git diff prompts/SP-002-clinerules-global.md` before committing.




### 6.3 — Example commit with prompt update


  git add proxy.py prompts/SP-007-gem-gemini-roo-agent.md


  git commit -m "chore(prompts): mise a jour SP-007 suite modification proxy.py - DEPLOIEMENT MANUEL REQUIS"




## RULE 7: LARGE FILE GENERATION — MANDATORY CHUNKING PROTOCOL



This rule applies to all modes that generate or write large files (>500 lines).




### 7.1 — When this rule applies



Whenever a file to be written exceeds approximately 500 lines, you MUST use the chunking protocol instead of attempting a single write_to_file call.




### 7.2 — Chunking protocol



1. Split the content into logical chunks of 400-500 lines each


2. Write each chunk to a numbered temp file: _temp_chunk_01.md, _temp_chunk_02.md, etc.


3. Verify each temp file was written successfully before proceeding


4. Assemble the final file using PowerShell:


   ```powershell


   Get-Content _temp_chunk_01.md, _temp_chunk_02.md, _temp_chunk_03.md | Set-Content target-file.md -Encoding UTF8


   ```


5. Verify the assembled file (line count, spot-check content)


6. Delete all temp chunk files:


   ```powershell


   Remove-Item _temp_chunk_*.md


   ```




### 7.3 — Why this protocol is mandatory



Single write_to_file calls on large files frequently fail silently or produce truncated output. The chunking protocol guarantees complete and correct file generation regardless of file size.






## RULE 8: DOCUMENTATION DISCIPLINE -- MANDATORY GOVERNANCE PROTOCOL


This rule applies to all modes and all sessions, without exception.



### 8.1 -- The Two Spaces

- docs/releases/vX.Y/ files with status **Frozen** are READ-ONLY for all agents. Never modify them.

- docs/releases/vX.Y/ files with status **Draft** or **In Review** may be modified ONLY by Architect or Product Owner persona.

- memory-bank/ files are agent-writable -- update them freely as working memory.



### 8.2 -- Idea Capture Mandate

When you identify a new requirement, improvement, or architectural change NOT in current release scope:


1. DO NOT modify the current release’s canonical docs (DOC-1..5).

2. ADD an entry to docs/ideas/IDEAS-BACKLOG.md with status [IDEA].

3. CREATE docs/ideas/IDEA-{NNN}-{slug}.md with description, motivation, and affected documents.

4. INFORM the human that a new idea has been captured.




### 8.3 -- Conversation Log Mandate

When saving an AI conversation output:


1. Save to docs/conversations/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{source}-{slug}.md

2. Add entry to docs/conversations/README.md with triage status “Not yet triaged”

3. Never edit a conversation file after creation.




### 8.4 -- Release Document References

Always use full qualified ID: “See DOC-2.3.1” not “See the architecture document.”



### 8.5 -- Execution Tracking

After each work session:


1. Update docs/releases/vX.Y/EXECUTION-TRACKER-vX.Y.md with session log entry.

2. Update memory-bank/progress.md with current checkbox state.

3. These two files must be consistent at end of every session.






## RULE 9: COLD ZONE FIREWALL -- MANDATORY MEMORY ACCESS PROTOCOL



### 9.1 -- Hot Zone (Read Directly)

Files in memory-bank/hot-context/ are read directly by the agent at session start (RULE 1).

### 9.2 -- Cold Zone (MCP Only)

Files in memory-bank/archive-cold/ MUST NOT be read directly by the agent.

All access to cold archive MUST go through the memory:query MCP tool:

  memory:query("your semantic query here")


### 9.3 -- Why This Rule Exists

Direct reading of cold archive files would:

1. Flood the context window with stale historical data

2. Cause “Lost in the Middle” errors on large projects

3. Defeat the purpose of the Hot/Cold architecture


### 9.4 -- Exception

The Librarian Agent (SP-010) is the ONLY agent authorized to read cold archive files

directly, for the purpose of indexing them into the vector database.




## RULE 10: GITFLOW ENFORCEMENT -- BRANCH LIFECYCLE

This rule applies to ALL modes. It is NON-NEGOTIABLE.

### 10.1 -- Branch Definitions

| Branch | Purpose | Lifecycle |
|--------|---------|----------|
| main | Production state. **Frozen.** Only receives merge commits from develop-vX.Y at release time. Tags mark releases. | Never deleted. Never committed to directly. |
| develop | **Wild mainline.** Ad-hoc features, experiments, quick fixes. No formal scope. | Long-lived. Never deleted. Always the base for develop-vX.Y. |
| develop-vX.Y | **Scoped backlog.** Created when IDEAs are formally triaged for vX.Y. All release-scope work lands here. | Created at release planning. Never deleted after merge — kept for traceability. |
| feature/{IDEA-NNN}-{slug} | Single feature or fix. | Branch from develop or develop-vX.Y, merge back via PR. Never deleted — kept for traceability. |
| hotfix/vX.Y.Z | Emergency production fix. | Branched from production tag on main. Merged to main and develop. Never deleted — kept for traceability. |

### 10.2 -- Forbidden Actions

- **NEVER** commit directly on main after a release tag
- **NEVER** commit on a branch that has been merged to main (use a new branch instead)
- **NEVER** commit feature work directly on a release or main branch -- use feature branches
- **ALL** new development (features, refactors, fixes) MUST target develop, develop-vX.Y, or a feature branch derived from them

### 10.3 -- Feature Branch Workflow

All new development (features, bug fixes, refactors) MUST follow this path:

1. Branch from develop (ad-hoc) or develop-vX.Y (scoped) -> feature/{IDEA-NNN}-{slug} or fix/{description}
2. Develop and test on the feature branch
3. Commit results to the feature branch
4. Merge via PR to the source branch (fast-forward or squash)
5. **Keep** the feature branch after merge — never delete it (traceability requirement)

> **Exception:** Governance-only commits (ADRs, RULE additions, docs fixes) that do not change application code MAY be committed directly on develop.

### 10.4 -- Release Workflow

1. Create develop-vX.Y from develop when IDEAs are formally triaged for vX.Y
2. All vX.Y-scope commits land on develop-vX.Y
3. When ready: create frozen docs in docs/releases/vX.Y/, tag vX.Y.0 on develop-vX.Y, merge to main
4. **Keep** develop-vX.Y after merge — never delete it (traceability requirement)
5. **Fast-forward develop to main** immediately after release merge:
   ```
   git checkout develop && git merge --ff main
   ```
   This restores the invariant: develop is always at or ahead of main, never behind.
6. Continue on develop for the next release cycle

### 10.5 -- Hotfix Exception

For critical production bugs:
1. Branch hotfix/vX.Y.Z from the production tag on main
2. Fix and test on the hotfix branch
3. Merge to main and to develop
4. Tag vX.Y.Z on both branches
5. **Keep** the hotfix branch after merge — never delete it (traceability requirement)

### 10.6 -- ADR Reference

This rule is documented as ADR-006 in memory-bank/hot-context/decisionLog.md.




## RULE 11: SYNCHRONIZATION AWARENESS — MANDATORY FOR ALL AGENTS

Before starting any significant implementation step, check for parallel work that might
overlap with yours. The Orchestrator runs sync detection at every intake — pay attention.

11.1 — Pre-implementation check: Read the DOC-3 execution chapter to see what other
       feature branches are active and what files they modify.

11.2 — Overlap detection: If your implementation touches files modified by another
       active branch, inform the human immediately. Do not create merge conflicts.

11.3 — Merge coordination: Do not merge a branch that creates conflicts with another
       active branch. Coordinate with the other developer (or human).

11.4 — Sync categories (from Orchestrator scan):
       - 🔴 CONFLICT: Two ideas require mutually exclusive changes — human must arbitrate
       - 🟡 REDUNDANCY: Two ideas solve the same problem — merge into single idea
       - 🔵 DEPENDENCY: Idea B needs Idea A first — reorder, communicate
       - 🟠 SHARED_LAYER: Multiple ideas touch same component — coordinate timing
       - 🟢 NO_OVERLAP: No conflicts detected — proceed normally

11.5 — On-demand scan: If the human asks "what else is in flight?", run a full scan
       of all active ideas and present a sync report.

11.6 — Branch merge: On-demand merging (continuous integration) — merge as soon as
       a feature is ready, do not wait for scheduled windows.




## RULE 12: CANONICAL DOCS — CUMULATIVE + GITHUB ACTIONS ENFORCEMENT

This rule applies to all modes. It is NON-NEGOTIABLE.


### 12.1 -- Cumulative Documentation Requirement

**R-CANON-0**: Each canonical doc in `docs/releases/vX.Y/` is **fully self-contained and cumulative** — it contains the complete state of that document for the entire project history up to vX.Y.

Canonical docs:
- DOC-1: Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- DOC-2: Technical Architecture
- DOC-3: Implementation Plan
- DOC-4: Operations Guide
- DOC-5: Release Notes

Minimum line counts for cumulative docs:
- DOC-1 >= 500 lines
- DOC-2 >= 500 lines
- DOC-3 >= 300 lines
- DOC-4 >= 300 lines
- DOC-5 >= 200 lines


### 12.2 -- GitFlow Rules for Canonical Docs

**R-CANON-1**: Canonical docs on `develop`: Only via feature branch (`feature/canon-doc-*`)

**R-CANON-2**: Canonical docs on `develop-vX.Y`: Only via feature branch scoped to that release

**R-CANON-3**: Direct commits on `develop` or `develop-vX.Y` to canonical docs are **FORBIDDEN**

**R-CANON-4**: Exception: Governance-only commits (ADRs, RULE additions) MAY be committed directly per RULE 10.3 exception


### 12.3 -- Consistency Rules

**R-CANON-5**: All 5 canonical docs MUST be updated together for any release

**R-CANON-6**: When merging to `develop-vX.Y`, all 5 DOC-*-vX.Y-*.md files must exist and be consistent

**R-CANON-7**: The `DOC-*-CURRENT.md` pointer files MUST all point to the same release version


### 12.4 -- Enforcement

Canonical docs enforcement is enforced by:
- **Git pre-receive hook** at `.githooks/pre-receive`
- **GitHub Actions CI** at `.github/workflows/canonical-docs-check.yml`
- These are deployed to new projects via `deploy-workbench-to-project.ps1`



## RULE 13: IDEATION INTAKE — MANDATORY FOR ALL AGENTS

Every human input that is not directly related to the agent's current task MUST be routed
to the Orchestrator Agent for intake processing.

13.1 — Detection: If the human expresses an idea, request, or remark that is outside the
       scope of your current task, it is an off-topic input.

13.2 — Routing: Route to Orchestrator with: raw idea text, your agent context, human's
       exact words. Do not say "I'll look into it" — route immediately.

13.3 — Acknowledgment: The Orchestrator will handle acknowledgment to the human.
       Do NOT ignore the input.

13.4 — Intake: The Orchestrator will assign an IDEA/TECH ID, classify the idea
       (business or technical), add it to the correct backlog, run sync detection,
       and inform the human with routing confirmation and sync opportunities.

13.5 — Classification:
       - BUSINESS (WHAT): User needs, features, product improvements → IDEAS-BACKLOG
       - TECHNICAL (HOW): Implementation approaches, technology choices → TECH-SUGGESTIONS-BACKLOG

13.6 — Refinement options: After intake, the human chooses:
       - [A] Refine now — structured requirement/feasibility session
       - [B] Park for later — marked DEFERRED
       - [C] Sync first — resolve overlap with existing ideas before refining




## RULE 14: DOC-3 EXECUTION CHAPTER — LIVE AT ALL TIMES
The DOC-3 execution tracking chapter is NOT a post-hoc summary. It is a live document
updated continuously throughout the implementation phase.

13.1 — End of session update: Before attempt_completion, update ALL THREE:
       - DOC-3 execution chapter (current step status per IDEA)
       - memory-bank/progress.md (checkbox states)
       - docs/releases/vX.Y/EXECUTION-TRACKER-vX.Y.md (session log)

13.2 — Consistency: These three files must ALWAYS be consistent with each other.
       If you update one, update all three.

13.3 — Status accuracy: Never mark a step as complete if:
       - Tests are failing
       - QA has not validated it
       - The feature branch has not been merged

13.4 — Tool-assisted generation: The AI generates a draft execution report at session
       end. The human reviews and approves before commit. Never commit execution status
       without human visibility.

13.5 — Pre-release freeze: 5 days before target release:
       - Day -5: Scope freeze (all ideas not REFINED deferred)
       - Day -4: Documentation coherence (DOC-1..DOC-5 aligned)
       - Day -3: Code coherence (all branches merged, full QA pass)
       - Day -2: Dry run release (RC1 tag, full test suite)
       - Day -1: Final review (human approves, vX.Y.0 tag applied)
       - Day 0: Announcement (DOC-5 published, GitHub release created)

13.6 — Hotfix priority: A hotfix ALWAYS interrupts a planned release. Branch from
       the production tag on main, fix, merge to main AND develop, then resume release.

13.7 — Refinement logging: Every refinement session produces a log entry in
       docs/conversations/REFINEMENT-YYYY-MM-DD-{id}.md with discussion summary,
       parked technical suggestions, final requirements, and status transitions.




## RULE 15: TECHNICAL SUGGESTIONS BACKLOG

Technical suggestions ("How" proposals) are tracked separately from business requirements
("What" proposals). They do NOT go directly into PRD or architecture — they are parked,
evaluated, and integrated appropriately.

14.1 — Capture: When a human proposes a technical solution (technology choice,
       implementation approach), park it in TECH-SUGGESTIONS-BACKLOG.md.

14.2 — Routing: Technical suggestions go to TECH-SUGGESTIONS-BACKLOG.md. Business
       requirements go to IDEAS-BACKLOG.md. Never mix the two tracks.

14.3 — Evaluation: The Architect evaluates technical suggestions for feasibility,
       impact, and risk. Decision: ACCEPTED / REJECTED / NEEDS_MORE_INFO.

14.4 — Integration: Accepted technical suggestions may update systemPatterns.md,
       DOC-2, or source code. They do NOT automatically become requirements.

14.5 — Creates requirements: If a technical suggestion generates business needs,
       it routes back to IDEAS-BACKLOG as a separate idea.

## Notes

> **Why CHECK→CREATE→READ→ACT?** Without the prior check, the agent would attempt to read a non-existent file and fail silently. The sequence guarantees that the Memory Bank is always initialized before being read.
```

## Deployment Notes

1. Open `.clinerules` at the root of the project
2. Replace **all content** with the text above (section "Prompt Content")
3. Save the file (ensure UTF-8 encoding without BOM)
4. Roo Code re-reads `.clinerules` automatically at each new session — no additional action required


## Impact on Other Prompts

- If RULE 5 is modified: check SP-005 (Developer) and SP-004 (Scrum Master) for consistency
- If RULE 6 is modified: no other prompt impacted
- If the XML tags in RULE 6 change: check SP-007 (Gem Gemini) for consistency
