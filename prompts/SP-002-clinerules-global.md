# PROTOCOL le workbench — MANDATORY DIRECTIVES (ALL SESSIONS, ALL MODES)

## RULE 1 : MANDATORY READ AT THE START OF EACH SESSION
Before any action, you MUST execute the following sequence in this exact order:

1. CHECK : Does memory-bank/activeContext.md exist?
   - If NO → proceed to the CREATE step
   - If YES → proceed to the READ step
2. CREATE (if absent) : Immediately create memory-bank/activeContext.md AND memory-bank/progress.md
   using the templates defined at the bottom of this file.
3. READ : Read memory-bank/activeContext.md then memory-bank/progress.md
4. ACT : Process the user's request

This CHECK→CREATE→READ→ACT sequence is NON-NEGOTIABLE and applies to ALL sessions.

## RULE 2 : MANDATORY WRITE AT THE CLOSE OF EACH TASK
Before closing any task (before attempt_completion), you MUST update:
1. memory-bank/activeContext.md  (new state, next action)
2. memory-bank/progress.md       (check off completed features)

If an architecture decision was made during the session:
3. memory-bank/decisionLog.md    (ADR with date, context, decision, consequences)

## RULE 3 : CONTEXTUAL READ BASED ON THE TASK
- Before modifying the architecture: read memory-bank/systemPatterns.md
- Before executing build/test commands: read memory-bank/techContext.md
- At the start of a sprint or new feature: read memory-bank/productContext.md

## RULE 4 : NO EXCEPTIONS TO RULES 1-3
These rules apply to ALL modes and ALL sessions, without exception.

## RULE 5 : MANDATORY AND SELF-CONTAINED GIT VERSIONING
This rule applies to all modes with access to the terminal (developer, scrum-master).

### 5.1 — What MUST be versioned
EVERYTHING must be versioned under Git, without exception:
- Application source code (src/, app/, etc.)
- System scripts (proxy.py, scripts/start-proxy.ps1, etc.)
- Configuration files (Modelfile, .roomodes, .clinerules, requirements.txt)
- The Memory Bank (memory-bank/*.md)
- System prompts (prompts/SP-*.md and prompts/README.md)
- Plans and architecture documents (workbench/*.md)
- QA reports (docs/qa/*.md)

### 5.2 — When to commit
You MUST execute a Git commit in the following situations:
- After creating or modifying a code file
- After updating the Memory Bank
- After modifying .roomodes, .clinerules, Modelfile or any file in prompts/
- After modifying proxy.py or any other script
- Before closing a task (before attempt_completion)

### 5.3 — Commit message format (Conventional Commits)
You MUST use the Conventional Commits format:
- feat(scope): description     -> New feature
- fix(scope): description      -> Bug fix
- docs(memory): description    -> Memory Bank update
- docs(plans): description     -> Documentation update
- chore(config): description   -> Configuration change
- chore(prompts): description  -> System prompt modification
- refactor(scope): description -> Refactoring without functional change
- test(scope): description     -> Adding or modifying tests

### 5.4 — Git commands to use
  git add .
  git commit -m "type(scope): description concise"

### 5.5 — What must NOT be versioned
- The venv/ folder (local Python environment)
- .env files (API keys — NEVER in Git)
- __pycache__/ files and *.pyc
- Logs (*.log)

## RULE 6 : PROMPT REGISTRY CONSISTENCY
This rule applies to developer and scrum-master modes.

### 6.1 — Before any commit touching an artifact linked to a prompt
If you modify one of the following files: proxy.py, .roomodes, .clinerules, Modelfile
you MUST check whether the change impacts a system prompt in prompts/.

### 6.2 — Verification procedure
1. Read prompts/README.md to identify the affected prompt
2. Open the corresponding SP-XXX file in prompts/
3. If the prompt content must change: modify SP-XXX, increment its version
4. If SP-007 (Gem Gemini) is impacted: add a warning in the commit:
   "MANUAL DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED: update the Gem Gemini with SP-007"
5. Include the modified prompts/ files in the same commit as the target files

### 6.3 — Example commit with prompt update
  git add proxy.py prompts/SP-007-gem-gemini-roo-agent.md
  git commit -m "chore(prompts): mise a jour SP-007 suite modification proxy.py - DEPLOIEMENT MANUEL REQUIS"

## Notes
> **Why CHECK→CREATE→READ→ACT?** Without the prior check, the agent would attempt to read a non-existent file and fail silently. The sequence guarantees that the Memory Bank is always initialized before being read.
```

## Deployment Notes

1. Open `.clinerules` at the root of the project
2. Replace **all content** with the text above (section "Prompt Content")
3. Save the file
4. Roo Code re-reads `.clinerules` automatically at each new session — no additional action required

## Impact on Other Prompts

- If RULE 5 is modified: check SP-005 (Developer) and SP-004 (Scrum Master) for consistency
- If RULE 6 is modified: no other prompt impacted
- If the XML tags in RULE 6 change: check SP-007 (Gem Gemini) for consistency
