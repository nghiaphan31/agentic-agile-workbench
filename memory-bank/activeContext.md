## Current task
Second-pass Anthropic Batch API review of the Agentic Agile Workbench vision completed and committed.

## Last result
### Batch 1 — DOC6 Expert Review (msgbatch_01QkGMqo8AXmRcSvqccVzX3G)
- Retrieved 2026-03-28 09:01 UTC
- 3 expert reviews: Coherence & Clarity, Architectural Analysis, Implementation Feasibility
- 23,502 input / 12,288 output tokens
- Results saved to `plans/batch-doc6-review/DOC6-REVIEW-RESULTS.md`
- Key findings: P0 issues (conversational framing, missing templates, PRD naming collision, undefined SP-00x/GAP-00x, systemPatterns.md genesis, missing glossary)

### Batch 2 — Second-Pass Vision Analysis (msgbatch_01X6jHRi8tHAh3fadCpsZq1s)
- Retrieved 2026-03-28 09:36 UTC
- 3 analyses: Vision Coherence, Core Workbench vs. Template Taxonomy, Migration Plan
- 217,032 input / 12,288 output tokens (10× larger context — both Gemini conversations + previous review)
- Results saved to `plans/batch-doc6-review/DOC6-REVIEW-RESULTS2.md`
- Key findings:
  - Both Gemini conversations are coherent and additive (no fundamental contradictions)
  - Phase 7 (Retrospective / Global Brain) is the major new concept from conversation 2
  - Definitive taxonomy: Core Workbench (factory, orchestration, cross-project) vs. Application Template (local execution, per-project memory)
  - Migration roadmap: Phase A (Hot/Cold memory) → Phase B (template enrichment) → Phase C (Calypso orchestration) → Phase D (Global Brain)
  - P0 unresolved: systemPatterns.md genesis, PRD naming collision, conversational framing, missing glossary
  - P0 resolved by conversation 2: Devil's Advocate loop (orchestrator_phase4.py), systemPatterns.md template, decisionLog.md ADR format

### New files added this session
- `plans/batch-doc6-review/submit_batch2.py` — Second-pass batch submission script (3 requests: vision coherence, taxonomy, migration plan)
- `plans/batch-doc6-review/retrieve_batch2.py` — Second-pass batch retrieval script
- `plans/batch-doc6-review/batch_id2.txt` — Batch ID: msgbatch_01X6jHRi8tHAh3fadCpsZq1s
- `plans/batch-doc6-review/DOC6-REVIEW-RESULTS.md` — First-pass review results (3 expert reviews)
- `plans/batch-doc6-review/DOC6-REVIEW-RESULTS2.md` — Second-pass vision analysis results (3 analyses)
- `workbench/_Agentic Workbench Architecture Explained .md` — Second Gemini conversation (deeper dive: Global Brain, Librarian Agent, Hot/Cold memory, Calypso scripts, taxonomy matrix)

## Next step(s)
- [ ] Read and integrate DOC6-REVIEW-RESULTS2.md findings into the product backlog / DOC6 revision plan
- [ ] Decide on migration Phase A: restructure memory-bank/ into Hot/Cold architecture
- [ ] Create SP-008 (Lead PM Agent), SP-009 (Analyst Agent), SP-010 (Librarian Agent) system prompts
- [ ] Update template/ folder: add memory-bank/ subdirectory structure, Hot/Cold split, systemPatterns.md blank template, decisionLog.md ADR format, mcp.json template
- [ ] Update .clinerules in template/ with Hot/Cold perimeter + Cold Zone Firewall
- [ ] Manual update of Gem Gemini "Roo Code Agent" with English instructions from `prompts/SP-007-gem-gemini-roo-agent.md` (v1.7.0)
- [ ] Switch back to `master` when branch experiment work is complete

## Blockers / Open questions
- P0 unresolved in DOC6: systemPatterns.md genesis, PRD naming collision, conversational framing, missing glossary
- Migration Phase A (Hot/Cold memory restructure) must be done before Calypso orchestration scripts are built
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` must be set in the environment before running any batch scripts
