# Active Context

**Last updated:** 2026-03-31T18:32:00Z
**Active mode:** Code
**Active LLM backend:** MinMax M2.7 via OpenRouter (minimax/minimax-m2.7)
**LLM Backend:** `minmax` (default via OpenRouter)
**Consecutive Errors:** `0`
**Fallback State:** Not triggered

## Git state
- Branch: `develop`
- Last commit: `4beae0f` — docs(memory): update activeContext after RULE 5.1 docs/folders fix

## Current task
**All 5 user requests from prior session completed:**
1. ✅ Complete gitflow explanation provided
2. ✅ 4 gitflow clarifications applied (keep branches, IDEA triage, develop ff, folders list)
3. ✅ GitFlow reference doc created (DOC-4-v2.4-Operations-Guide.md with mermaid diagrams)
4. ✅ SP-002/.clinerules sync issue fully explained (write access log, root cause)
5. ✅ PowerShell clarified — only specific `+=` array concatenation in pipeline is problematic

## Last result
- `.clinerules`: RULE 10/5.1 updated with all 4 clarifications
- `prompts/SP-002`: rebuilt from `.clinerules` (0 diff, 6/6 SPs passing)
- `docs/releases/v2.4/DOC-4-v2.4-Operations-Guide.md`: created with full GitFlow reference + mermaid
- `docs/DOC-4-CURRENT.md`: pointer updated to v2.4
- Temp files cleaned up

## Next step(s)
- [ ] Push develop to origin (if not already pushed)

## Blockers / Open questions
- SP-007 Gem Gemini requires manual deployment at https://gemini.google.com > Gems

## Coherence Status (SP-002 v2.7.0)
- SP-001 (Modelfile): PASS
- SP-002 (.clinerules): PASS (v2.7.0 — RULE 5.1 folders list complete, RULE 10 branches kept)
- SP-003 (.roomodes product-owner): PASS
- SP-004 (.roomodes scrum-master): PASS
- SP-005 (.roomodes developer): PASS
- SP-006 (.roomodes qa-engineer): PASS
- SP-007 (Gem Gemini): WARN (manual deployment required)

## Ideation-to-Release — Key Decisions Captured
| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| Intake Agent | Orchestrator (any agent can route) |
| Refinement approach | Orchestrator decides based on complexity score |
| Branch merge | On-demand (continuous integration) |
| Hotfix priority | Always interrupts planned release |
| DOC-3 tracking | Tool-assisted (AI drafts, human approves) |
| Tracking method | Option B: One IDEA per phase (live-test process) |
