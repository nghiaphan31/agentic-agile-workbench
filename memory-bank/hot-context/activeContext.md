## Current task
**GITFLOW violation remediated — Option A cherry-pick (10 commits to develop)**

Session objective: Implement the complete ad-hoc idea governance model.

Completed across sessions:
- ✅ PHASE-A Foundation: TECH-SUGGESTIONS-BACKLOG, RULE 11-14, template updates
- ✅ PHASE-B Core Logic: SyncDetector + RefinementWorkflow
- ✅ PHASE-C Full Features: BranchTracker, IntakeAgent, ExecutionTracker, Dashboard
- ✅ PHASE-5 QA: IDEA-012C verified (19/19 integration tests PASS)

All IDEA-012A/B/C now [IMPLEMENTED] + QA complete

## Last result
All 10 commits now on develop. ADR-011 created. DOC-3-CURRENT.md updated with AD-HOC WORK section.

## Next step(s)
- [x] GITFLOW violation remediated (ADR-011)
- [x] AD-HOC WORK section added to DOC-3-CURRENT.md
- [ ] Push develop to origin

## Blockers / Open questions
- SP-007 Gem Gemini requires manual deployment at https://gemini.google.com > Gems

## Coherence Status (SP-002 v2.7.0)
- SP-001 (Modelfile): PASS
- SP-002 (.clinerules): PASS (v2.7.0 — RULE 11-14 added)
- SP-003 (.roomodes product-owner): PASS
- SP-004 (.roomodes scrum-master): PASS
- SP-005 (.roomodes developer): PASS
- SP-006 (.roomodes qa-engineer): PASS
- SP-007 (Gem Gemini): WARN (manual deployment required)

## Ideation-to-Release — Key Decisions Captured
| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| Intake Agent | Orchestrator (any agent can route) |
| Refinement approach | Orchestrator decides based on complexity score |
| Branch merge | On-demand (continuous integration) |
| Hotfix priority | Always interrupts planned release |
| DOC-3 tracking | Tool-assisted (AI drafts, human approves) |
| Tracking method | Option B: One IDEA per phase (live-test process) |
