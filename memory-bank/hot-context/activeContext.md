## Ideation-to-Release — Key Decisions
| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| Intake Agent | Orchestrator (any agent can route) |
| Refinement approach | Orchestrator decides based on complexity score |
| Branch merge | On-demand (continuous integration) |
| Hotfix priority | Always interrupts planned release |
| DOC-3 tracking | Tool-assisted (AI drafts, human approves) |
| SP-002 sync | Always use `python scripts/rebuild_sp002.py` |
