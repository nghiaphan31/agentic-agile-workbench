## PART 1: Workbench Deployment Guide

﻿# Document 4: Workbench Deployment Guide
## How to use this template on a new project or an existing codebase

**Project Name:** Agentic Agile Workbench
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-03-23
**References:** DOC1-PRD-Workbench-Requirements.md v2.0, DOC2-ARCH-Workbench-Technical-Design.md v2.0, DOC3-BUILD-Workbench-Assembly-Phases.md v3.0

## 1. Understanding What This Repository Is (and Is Not)

### 1.1 This Repository = The Workbench, Not the Product

The most important distinction to understand before any deployment:

```
agentic-agile-workbench/   ← YOU ARE HERE
│                                     This is the WORKBENCH
│
│  workbench/          ← The workbench blueprints (DOC1, DOC2, DOC3, DOC4)
│  prompts/        ← The workbench tools (system prompts SP-001 to SP-007)
│  proxy.py        ← A workbench machine (Roo Code <-> Gemini Chrome bridge)
│  .roomodes       ← The workbench worker roles (4 Agile personas)
│  .clinerules     ← The workbench rulebook (6 mandatory rules)
│  scripts/        ← The workbench utility scripts
│
└── It produces PROJECTS (separate repositories, in other folders)
```

**This repository contains no application code.** It contains the rules, tools, processes and system prompts that enable developing any project in an agentic, agile and versioned manner.

**Analogy:** Think of it as a carpentry workshop. The workshop contains the tools (saws, planes, hammers), workbenches, and safety rules. The furniture produced (the projects) are separate entities that leave the workshop once completed.

### 1.2 What This Repository Contains

| File / Folder | Role in the Workbench | Analogy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `workbench/DOC1-PRD-*.md` | Requirements of the workbench itself | Workbench manual |
| `workbench/DOC2-Architecture-*.md` | Technical architecture of the workbench | Machine blueprints |
| `workbench/DOC3-Plan-Implementation-*.md` | Workbench installation guide | Assembly instructions |
| `workbench/DOC4-Guide-Deploiement-*.md` | This document — how to use the workbench | User manual |
| `template/prompts/SP-001 to SP-007` | Canonical system prompts | Worker job descriptions |
| `.roomodes` | Definition of the 4 Agile personas | Workbench org chart |
| `.clinerules` | 6 mandatory rules for all modes | Internal regulations |
| `template/proxy.py` | Roo Code ↔ Gemini Chrome bridge | Relay machine |
| `scripts/` | Utility scripts | Automated tools |

### 1.3 What This Repository Does NOT Contain

- ❌ Your application source code (that lives in the project repository)
- ❌ Your project's Memory Bank (that lives in the project repository)
- ❌ Your project's QA reports (that lives in the project repository)
- ❌ Your project's User Stories (that lives in the project's Memory Bank)

### 1.4 Why Version This Repository?

This repository will evolve over time. You will update it when:
- A `.clinerules` rule proves insufficient or ambiguous → you fix it here
- You add a new persona (e.g.: DevOps Engineer, Architect) → you add it in `.roomodes` and `prompts/`
- You improve `template/proxy.py` (new timeout, better error handling) → you update it here
- You discover a more effective Memory Bank pattern → you update the templates in `.clinerules`

**Every workbench improvement benefits all future projects.** That is the value of separating the workbench from the projects.

## 3. Deployment on a New Project

### 3.1 Prerequisites

Before starting, the workbench must be installed and functional on your machine (phases 0-12 of DOC3). In particular:
- Ollama with `uadf-agent` available (Mode 1) OR proxy.py started (Mode 2) OR Anthropic key configured (Mode 3)
- VS Code with the Roo Code extension installed

### 3.2 Step 1 — Create the New Project Repository

```powershell
# Canonical structure:
# $env:USERPROFILE\AGENTIC_DEVELOPMENT_PROJECTS\
# ├── agentic-agile-workbench\   ← THE WORKBENCH (master template, do not modify)
# └── PROJECTS\                  ← All application projects
#     └── my-new-project\

$Atelier = "$env:USERPROFILE\AGENTIC_DEVELOPMENT_PROJECTS\agentic-agile-workbench"
$Projet  = "$env:USERPROFILE\AGENTIC_DEVELOPMENT_PROJECTS\PROJECTS\my-new-project"

# Create the new project folder (under PROJECTS\, separate from the workbench)
New-Item -Path $Projet -ItemType Directory -Force
cd $Projet

# Initialize Git
git init
git branch -M main
```

> **Important:** The new project is a Git repository **separate** from the workbench. The workbench (`agentic-agile-workbench/`) is the **protected master template** — never create a project inside it. All application projects live under `AGENTIC_DEVELOPMENT_PROJECTS\PROJECTS\`.

### 3.3 Step 2 — Deploy the Workbench Files

The deployment script automatically copies all necessary files and creates the Memory Bank:

```powershell
# One-command deployment (from anywhere)
$Atelier = "$env:USERPROFILE\AGENTIC_DEVELOPMENT_PROJECTS\agentic-agile-workbench"
$Projet  = "$env:USERPROFILE\AGENTIC_DEVELOPMENT_PROJECTS\PROJECTS\my-new-project"

& "$Atelier\template\scripts\deploy-to-project.ps1" -ProjectPath $Projet
```

The script deploys: `.roomodes`, `.clinerules`, `Modelfile`, `proxy.py`, `requirements.txt`, `prompts/`, `scripts/`, `memory-bank/` (7 empty files), `docs/qa/`.

### 3.4 Step 3 — Create the `.gitignore`

Create `.gitignore` at the project root:

```
# Python environment
venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo

# API keys — NEVER in Git
.env
*.env

# Logs
*.log

# OS
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

### 3.5 Step 4 — Initialize the Memory Bank

> **This step is automated by the `deploy-to-project.ps1` script** (section 3.3). The Memory Bank (7 files) and `docs/qa/` are created automatically. Skip directly to step 5.

If you need to recreate manually:

```powershell
$Projet = "$env:USERPROFILE\AGENTIC_DEVELOPMENT_PROJECTS\PROJECTS\my-new-project"

New-Item -Path "$Projet\memory-bank" -ItemType Directory
@("projectBrief.md","productContext.md","systemPatterns.md","techContext.md",
  "activeContext.md","progress.md","decisionLog.md") | ForEach-Object {
    New-Item -Path "$Projet\memory-bank\$_" -ItemType File
}
New-Item -Path "$Projet\docs\qa" -ItemType Directory -Force
New-Item -Path "$Projet\docs\qa\.gitkeep" -ItemType File
```

### 3.6 Step 5 — Fill in `memory-bank/projectBrief.md`

This is **the only mandatory manual step** before opening Roo Code. Open `memory-bank/projectBrief.md` and fill in:

```markdown
# Project Brief

## Project Vision
[2-3 sentences describing what this project does and for whom]

## Main Objectives
1. [Objective 1 — measurable]
2. [Objective 2 — measurable]
3. [Objective 3 — measurable]

## Non-Goals (What this project does NOT do)
- [Non-goal 1 — important to prevent scope creep]
- [Non-goal 2]

## Constraints
- [Technical constraint: e.g.: must run on Python 3.11+]
- [Business constraint: e.g.: must comply with GDPR]

## Stakeholders
- Product Owner: [Your name]
- Target users: [Description of end users]
```

> **Why fill this in manually?** Roo Code cannot invent your project's vision. This is the only information you must provide. Everything else (architecture, code, tests, documentation) will be generated by the agent.

### 3.7 Step 6 — First Commit

```powershell
cd "$Projet"
git add .
git commit -m "chore(init): project initialization with workbench v2.0"
```

### 3.8 Step 7 — Open in VS Code and Start

```powershell
code "$Projet"
```

In VS Code:
1. Select the **"Product Owner"** mode in Roo Code
2. Send: `Read projectBrief.md and create the first User Stories in memory-bank/productContext.md`
3. The agent reads the vision, creates the User Stories, commits automatically

**The workbench is operational on your new project.**

---

## 4. Deployment on an Existing Codebase (Spaghetti Code)

### 4.1 Why It's Different

With a new project, the Memory Bank is empty and fills up progressively. With an existing project, the Memory Bank must be filled **first** — before any refactoring — so the agent understands what it is going to modify.

**Risk without this step:** The agent refactors without understanding the hidden dependencies of the spaghetti code → it breaks existing functionality.

### 4.2 Step 1 — Open the Existing Project

```powershell
# If the legacy project is already in AGENTIC_DEVELOPMENT_PROJECTS\PROJECTS\
$Projet = "$env:USERPROFILE\AGENTIC_DEVELOPMENT_PROJECTS\PROJECTS\my-legacy-project"
# Otherwise, adapt the path to the current project location
cd $Projet

# If Git is not yet initialized
git init
git add .
git commit -m "chore(init): initial state before le workbench refactoring"
```

> **Committing the initial state is critical.** This creates a safe rollback point if the refactoring goes in the wrong direction.

### 4.3 Step 2 — Copy the Workbench Files

Identical to the "New Project" case (section 3.3):

```powershell
$Atelier = "$env:USERPROFILE\AGENTIC_DEVELOPMENT_PROJECTS\agentic-agile-workbench"
$Projet  = "$env:USERPROFILE\AGENTIC_DEVELOPMENT_PROJECTS\PROJECTS\my-legacy-project"
# (or the current path of the legacy project if different)

& "$Atelier\template\scripts\deploy-to-project.ps1" -ProjectPath $Projet
```

### 4.4 Step 3 — Create the Memory Bank (with existing context)

```powershell
New-Item -Path "$Projet" -Name "memory-bank" -ItemType Directory
# Create the 7 files (identical to section 3.5)
```

### 4.5 Step 4 — Audit the Existing Code (CRITICAL)

This is **the most important step** for an existing project. It does not exist for a new project.

Open VS Code on the project, select the **"Developer"** mode in Roo Code, and send:

```
Perform a complete audit of the source code in this project.
For each point below, document your findings in the indicated file:

1. In memory-bank/projectBrief.md:
   - What is the main function of this project?
   - Who are the apparent target users?
   - What are the visible technical constraints?

2. In memory-bank/systemPatterns.md:
   - What is the folder architecture?
   - What naming conventions are used (even if inconsistent)?
   - What technical patterns are used (even if poorly implemented)?
   - What anti-patterns do you identify? (tight coupling, duplication, etc.)
   - What are the critical dependencies between modules?

3. In memory-bank/techContext.md:
   - What is the language and version?
   - What are the dependencies (requirements.txt, package.json, etc.)?
   - What are the commands to run and test the project?
   - Are there required environment variables?

4. In memory-bank/decisionLog.md:
   - Document the apparent architecture decisions (even implicit ones)
   - Note the identified technical debts

Commit each Memory Bank file as you go.
```

> **Why let the agent do the audit?** The agent reads the code without preconceptions. It identifies the real patterns (not the ones you think you implemented). It documents in a structured and versioned manner. You can correct its conclusions if necessary.

### 4.6 Step 5 — Define the Refactoring Strategy

After the audit, select the **"Product Owner"** mode and send:

```
Read memory-bank/systemPatterns.md and memory-bank/projectBrief.md.
Based on the identified anti-patterns and the project vision,
create the refactoring User Stories in memory-bank/productContext.md.

Each User Story must:
- Address a specific anti-pattern identified in the audit
- Have measurable acceptance criteria
- Be independent of the others (so it can be delivered separately)
- Be ordered by priority (dependencies first)
```

### 4.7 Step 6 — Refactoring Guided by User Stories

Refactoring is done User Story by User Story, in the order defined by the Product Owner:

```
For each User Story:

1. Developer Mode:
   "Implement User Story US-XXX defined in memory-bank/productContext.md.
    Read systemPatterns.md first to respect the target conventions.
    Commit after each significant modification."

2. QA Engineer Mode:
   "Test the changes from User Story US-XXX.
    Write the report in docs/qa/test-US-XXX-[DATE].md."

3. Scrum Master Mode:
   "Update memory-bank/progress.md to mark US-XXX as done.
    Identify any impediments."
```

> **Why User Story by User Story?** Spaghetti code has hidden dependencies. Refactoring in small versioned increments allows detecting regressions immediately and rolling back if necessary (`git revert`).

## 5. What Stays in the Workbench vs What Goes in the Project

This table is the reference for knowing where each file should live:

| File / Folder | Stays in Workbench | Goes in Each Project | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| `workbench/DOC1/DOC2/DOC3/DOC4` | ✅ | ❌ | Workbench documentation — not project documentation |
| `.roomodes` | ✅ (template) | ✅ (copy) | Copied, can be adapted per project |
| `.clinerules` | ✅ (template) | ✅ (copy) | Copied, can be adapted per project |
| `Modelfile` | ✅ (template) | ✅ (copy) | Copied if Ollama Mode is used |
| `template/proxy.py` | ✅ (template) | ✅ (copy) | Copied if Gemini Mode is used |
| `requirements.txt` | ✅ (template) | ✅ (copy) | Copied if Gemini Mode is used |
| `scripts/` | ✅ (template) | ✅ (copy) | Copied to each project |
| `template/prompts/SP-*.md` | ✅ (source of truth) | ✅ (copy) | Copied — the project has its own versioned copy |
| `template/prompts/README.md` | ✅ (template) | ✅ (copy) | Copied |
| `memory-bank/` | ❌ | ✅ (specific) | Unique per project — never copy from one project to another |
| `src/` (application code) | ❌ | ✅ (specific) | Unique per project |
| `docs/qa/` | ❌ | ✅ (specific) | Project-specific QA reports |

### 5.1 Why Copy Files Rather Than Reference Them?

You might think about using Git submodules or symbolic links to avoid duplication. **Do not do this.** Here is why:

- **Independence:** Each project must be able to evolve independently. If you improve `.clinerules` in the workbench, you choose when and whether to update each project.
- **Traceability:** The version of `.clinerules` used in a project is versioned in that project. You know exactly which version of the workbench was active when a bug was introduced.
- **Simplicity:** No inter-repository dependencies to manage. Each project is self-contained.

## 6. Dashboard of the 3 LLM Modes by Use Case

| Mode | Recommended Use Case | Advantage | Disadvantage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mode 1 — Local Ollama** | Daily development, repetitive tasks, simple code | Free, offline, 100% automatic | Slower than Claude, variable quality on complex tasks |
| **Mode 2 — Gemini Proxy** | Complex tasks when Ollama is insufficient, without API budget | Free, high quality | Manual copy-paste required for each request |
| **Mode 3 — Claude API** | Complex refactoring, architecture, critical decisions | Best quality, 100% automatic | Pay per use |

**Practical recommendation:**
- Start in Mode 1 (Ollama) for simple tasks
- Switch to Mode 3 (Claude) for architecture decisions and complex refactoring
- Use Mode 2 (Gemini) as a free alternative to Mode 3 if budget is a constraint

## 7. Project Lifecycle with the Workbench

> **Reference:** The complete process (phases, artifacts, nomenclature, agentic anti-risks) is described in **[DOC5] `workbench/DOC5-GUIDE-Project-Development-Process.md`**. This document (DOC4) covers only the workbench deployment. DOC5 covers how to work with the workbench once deployed.

## 8. Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I need to recreate the Gemini Gem for each project?

**No.** The "Roo Code Agent" Gemini Gem is configured once in your Google account. It is generic — it responds to Roo Code requests regardless of the project type. You do not need to recreate it.

### Q: Do I need to reinstall Ollama for each project?

**No.** Ollama is a Windows daemon running in the background. The `uadf-agent` model is compiled once. You only need to ensure Ollama is running (icon in the notification area) before opening Roo Code.

### Q: Can I adapt `.roomodes` for a specific project?

**Yes.** For example, if a project requires a "DevOps Engineer" persona, you can add it in the project's copy of `.roomodes`. The workbench is not modified. If the adaptation is useful for all future projects, you can then port it back to the workbench.

### Q: What to do if the agent does not follow the `.clinerules` rules?

1. Verify that `.clinerules` is at the project root (not in a subfolder)
2. Reload VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+P` > "Developer: Reload Window")
3. If the problem persists, verify that the rule is formulated imperatively and not suggestively

### Q: How to update a project when the workbench evolves?

1. Identify what changed in the workbench (consult the workbench's `git log`)
2. Manually copy the modified files to the project
3. Commit in the project with an explicit message: `chore(workbench): update workbench v[X.Y] — [description of change]`

### Q: Can I have multiple projects open simultaneously in VS Code?

**Yes**, via VS Code workspaces. Each project has its own `.roomodes` and `.clinerules`. Roo Code reads the files from the project currently open in VS Code.

| **SP** | System Prompt | Canonical file in the `template/prompts/` registry with YAML metadata. |
| **SSE** | Server-Sent Events | HTTP server→client streaming protocol. Used by the proxy to return Gemini responses. |
| **le workbench** | Agentic Agile Workbench | Name of the system described in the workbench documents. |

## Appendix C — Glossary

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Workbench** | This repository (`agentic-agile-workbench`). Contains the reusable tools, rules and processes for developing application projects. Contrasts with the "project" which contains the business code. Analogy: carpentry workshop vs. furniture produced. |
| **Code audit** | Mandatory step when deploying on an existing codebase. The Developer reads the source code and fills the Memory Bank (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) with the identified patterns, anti-patterns and technical debts. |
| **Roo Code XML tags** | Roo Code action syntax: `<write_to_file>`, `<read_file>`, `<execute_command>`, `<attempt_completion>`, etc. Any connected LLM must respond with these tags. |
| **Spaghetti code** | Poorly structured source code, without clear architecture, difficult to maintain. Deploying the workbench on spaghetti code requires a prior audit step before any modification. |
| **Initial commit** | First Git commit of a project, made before any workbench deployment. For an existing project: `git commit -m "chore(init): initial state before le workbench refactoring"`. Creates a safe rollback point. |
| **Deployment** | Copying workbench files (`template/`) into an application project. Can be done manually or via `deploy-to-project.ps1`. |
| **deploy-to-project.ps1** | PowerShell script in `template/scripts/` that automates deployment. Parameters: `-ProjectPath` (required), `-Update` (update), `-DryRun` (simulation without writing). |
| **Gemini Gem** | Gemini Web profile with permanent system prompt (SP-007). Created once in the Gemini interface — shared across all projects using Proxy Mode. |
| **Memory Bank** | 7 Markdown files in `memory-bank/` of the project persisting context between sessions. Created during deployment, progressively filled by the Agile personas. |
| **Workbench update** | Process of propagating a new workbench version to existing projects. Triggered by `deploy-to-project.ps1 -Update` or manually. Described in `CHANGELOG.md`. |
| **Cloud Mode** | Roo Code → direct Anthropic API (`claude-sonnet-4-6`). Fully automated, pay per use. |
| **Local Mode** | Roo Code (`pc`) → Ollama `calypso:11434` (Tailscale) → Qwen3-32B. Free, sovereign, private network. |
| **Proxy Mode** | Roo Code → FastAPI proxy `localhost:8000` → clipboard → Gemini Web. Free, requires human copy-paste. |
| **Agile Persona** | Roo Code mode simulating a Scrum role: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developer, QA Engineer. Each persona has precise RBAC permissions. |
| **Application project** | Git repository containing the business code of an application. Distinct from the workbench. Receives workbench files during deployment. |
| **CHECK→CREATE→READ→ACT sequence** | Mandatory protocol at the start of each Roo Code session in a deployed project. Defined in RULE 1 of `.clinerules`. |
| **SemVer** | Semantic Versioning. MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format: MAJOR = breaking change, MINOR = new feature, PATCH = fix. Used to version the workbench (`VERSION`) and SP files. |
| **Template** | `template/` directory of the workbench containing all files to copy into application projects. Distinct from `workbench/` which contains the documentation. |
| **`.workbench-version`** | File created at the root of each deployed project, containing the workbench version used (e.g.: `2.0.0`). Allows knowing which workbench version is deployed in each project. |

## PART 2: Application Agile Process Manual

# Document 5: Application Agile Process Manual
## How to develop an application project with the Agentic Agile Workbench

**Project Name:** Agentic Agile Workbench
**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** 2026-03-23
**References:** DOC1-PRD v2.0, DOC2-Architecture v2.0, DOC3-Plan v3.0, DOC4-Guide-Deploiement v1.0

---

## Preamble: Why This Document?

Documents DOC1 to DOC4 describe **the workbench itself**: its requirements, its architecture, its installation, its deployment. They do not describe **how to work with the workbench** to produce application or business software.

This document answers the question: **"I have the workbench operational. How do I develop my project?"**

It covers:
1. The **Agile process** adapted to agentic development
2. The **nomenclature and templates** of all artifacts in an application project
3. The **anti-risk mechanisms** specific to agentic development (memory loss, hallucination, multi-sessions over several months)
4. The **open upstream phase**: how to transform unstructured narrative ideas into structured artifacts
5. The **traceability and versioning** of the entire process

### Convention: Ready-to-Copy-Paste Prompts

This document uses a visual convention to distinguish explanations from operational actions.

`PROMPT` blocks are **prompts ready to copy-paste into Roo Code**. Each block is **self-contained**: you can copy-paste it without having read the rest of the document, and the agent will execute the complete step autonomously.

**Format of a PROMPT block:**

> **PROMPT [X.Y] — [Title]**
> **Required Roo Code mode:** `[mode-slug]`
> **Complexity:** [Simple (1 send, autonomous agent) | Iterative (human/agent dialogue) | Sequential (several prompts to chain)]
> **Copy-paste the block below as-is:**

```markdown
[Prompt text — self-contained, ready to paste into Roo Code]
```

*-> Artifact produced: `path/file.md`*

### Distinction: User Prompts (this document) vs System Prompts (`template/prompts/`)

This document contains **User Prompts** — operational instructions that **the human sends to the agent** to trigger a precise step of the Agile workflow (Sprint Planning, User Story development, etc.).

They are distinct from the **System Prompts** stored in `template/prompts/` (files SP-001 to SP-007), which configure the identity and behavioral rules of the AI agents. The latter are deployed in technical files (`.clinerules`, `.roomodes`, `Modelfile`) and apply permanently, in the background, for all sessions.

| | User Prompts (this document) | System Prompts (`template/prompts/`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Role** | Trigger a workflow action | Configure the agent's identity and rules |
| **Used by** | The human (copy-paste into Roo Code) | The AI agent (automatically, in the background) |
| **Scope** | One precise task, one session | All sessions, all modes |
| **Target** | Roo Code chat interface | `.clinerules`, `.roomodes`, `Modelfile`, Gemini Gem |
| **Frequency** | At each workflow step | Once deployed, then maintenance |

## 1. Process Overview

### 1.1 Fundamental Principles

The process rests on **four non-negotiable principles**:

| Principle | Description | Workbench Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Persistent Memory** | All context is written, never assumed to be memorized | Memory Bank (7 `.md` files) |
| **Total Traceability** | Every artifact is versioned with its history | Git + Conventional Commits |
| **Progressive Convergence** | Narrative inputs mature toward structured artifacts | Phase 0 -> Phase 1 -> Phase 2 |
| **Defense in Depth** | Each rule is redundant (`.clinerules` + `roleDefinition` + protocols) | `.clinerules` + `.roomodes` |

## 2. Phase 0 - Open Upstream: From Idea to Artifacts

### 2.1 Why an Open Upstream Phase?

Software development rarely starts with a structured specification. It starts with:
- A 3-line email: "We need a tool to manage our customer orders"
- A conversation: "The problem is that sales reps enter data twice"
- Existing code without documentation: "Here's what we have, it needs to be redone properly"
- Disorganized notes across multiple documents
- A vague idea that evolves through discussions

**The workbench must accept these inputs as-is** and progressively transform them into structured artifacts. That is the role of Phase 0.

> **Golden rule of Phase 0:** Never force a premature structure. Let understanding mature before structuring.

### 2.2 Inputs Accepted in Phase 0

| Input Type | Example | Processing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Free narrative text** | Email, note, meeting minutes | Copy as-is into BRIEF-001 |
| **Existing code** | Legacy repository, scripts, prototypes | Developer audit -> BRIEF-002 |
| **Oral conversation** | Transcription, meeting notes | Copy as-is into BRIEF-001 |
| **Word/PDF document** | Partial specification, functional spec | Extract text -> BRIEF-001 |
| **Mockups/Wireframes** | Images, screenshots | Describe in text -> BRIEF-001 |
| **Vague idea** | "I want something like Trello but for..." | Product Owner dialogue -> BRIEF-001 |

### 2.3 Phase 0 Maturation Process

---

#### Step 0.1 — Collect raw inputs

> **PROMPT 0.1 — Collect raw inputs**
> **Required Roo Code mode:** `product-owner`
> **Complexity:** Simple — 1 send, replace [RAW INPUTS] with your data before sending
> **Copy-paste the block below as-is, then replace [RAW INPUTS]:**

```markdown
Create the file docs/brief/BRIEF-001-vision-narrative.md with the following content,
copied exactly as-is without reformulating:

---
# BRIEF-001 - Raw Narrative Vision
**Creation date:** [DATE]
**Created by:** Product Owner
**Status:** Draft

## Raw Inputs

### Input 1 - [Source: email / meeting / note / existing code]
**Date:** [DATE]
**Author:** [NAME]

[RAW INPUTS -- paste here emails, notes, conversations, descriptions as-is]

## Addition History
| Date | Source | Summary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [DATE] | [SOURCE] | [SUMMARY IN 1 LINE] |
---

Commit with: 'docs(brief): initial narrative vision - upstream phase'
```

*-> Artifact produced: `docs/brief/BRIEF-001-vision-narrative.md`*

---

#### Step 0.2 — Structured analysis

> **PROMPT 0.2 — Structured analysis of raw inputs**
> **Required Roo Code mode:** `developer`
> **Complexity:** Simple — 1 send, the agent produces BRIEF-002 autonomously
> **Copy-paste the block below as-is:**

```markdown
Read docs/brief/BRIEF-001-vision-narrative.md.
Identify and list in docs/brief/BRIEF-002-synthese-structuree.md:
- The mentioned features (even implicitly)
- The identifiable target users
- The technical or business constraints
- The ambiguities and open questions
- What is apparently out of scope
Do not make any decisions. Only document what you understand.
Commit with: 'docs(brief): structured synthesis upstream phase'
```

*-> Artifact produced: `docs/brief/BRIEF-002-synthese-structuree.md`*

---

#### Step 0.3 — Clarification of ambiguities

> **PROMPT 0.3 — Clarification of ambiguities**
> **Required Roo Code mode:** `product-owner`
> **Complexity:** Iterative — question/answer dialogue until all critical ambiguities are resolved
> **Copy-paste the block below as-is:**

```markdown
Read docs/brief/BRIEF-002-synthese-structuree.md.
For each ambiguity listed in the "Ambiguities and Open Questions" section,
ask me one precise question.
Wait for my answer before moving to the next one.
Update BRIEF-002 with each answer obtained, marking the question as "Resolved".
```

*-> Iterative dialogue until critical ambiguities are resolved. BRIEF-002 updated.*

---

#### Step 0.4 — GO/NO-GO launch decision

> **PROMPT 0.4 — GO/NO-GO launch decision**
> **Required Roo Code mode:** `product-owner`
> **Complexity:** Simple — 1 send, the agent creates BRIEF-003 and commits the 3 artifacts
> **Copy-paste the block below as-is:**

```markdown
Based on docs/brief/BRIEF-001-vision-narrative.md and
docs/brief/BRIEF-002-synthese-structuree.md,
create docs/brief/BRIEF-003-decision-lancement.md with:
- The GO / NO-GO / HOLD decision
- The launch conditions if HOLD
- The decision date
- The identified risks and their mitigation
- The validated scope for launch

Commit the 3 BRIEF files with the message:
'docs(brief): upstream phase complete - decision [GO/NO-GO]'
```

*-> Artifact produced: `docs/brief/BRIEF-003-decision-lancement.md`*
*-> Git commit of the 3 BRIEF artifacts*

---

### 2.4 Phase 0 Exit Criteria

Phase 0 is complete when:
- [ ] BRIEF-001 exists and contains all raw inputs
- [ ] BRIEF-002 exists and lists features, users, constraints, ambiguities
- [ ] All critical ambiguities are resolved (or documented as accepted)
- [ ] BRIEF-003 contains a GO decision
- [ ] The 3 files are committed in Git

> **If the decision is NO-GO or HOLD:** Archive the BRIEF files in `docs/brief/archive/` and commit. The project can resume later starting from these artifacts.

---

## 3. Phase 1 - Framing: Project Initialization

### 3.1 Objective

Transform the GO decision from Phase 0 into a structured and operational project base: Memory Bank filled, initial architecture defined, initial backlog created.

> **Complexity:** Iterative — the agent lists any inconsistencies, dialogue if corrections needed
> **Copy-paste the block below as-is:**

```markdown
Read docs/architecture/PRJ-002-architecture-initiale.md.
Verify that the proposed architecture is consistent with:
- The vision in memory-bank/projectBrief.md
- The identified constraints
- The Non-Goals

If inconsistencies exist, list them.
If the architecture is validated, update docs/brief/BRIEF-003-decision-lancement.md
with the mention 'Architecture validated on [DATE]' and commit.
```

*-> Artifact updated: `docs/brief/BRIEF-003-decision-lancement.md` (validation mention)*

---

#### Step 1.4 — Structured Initial Backlog

> **PROMPT 1.4 — Creation of the initial MoSCoW backlog**
> **Required Roo Code mode:** `product-owner`
> **Complexity:** Simple — 1 send, the agent creates the structured backlog with MoSCoW prioritization
> **Copy-paste the block below as-is:**

```markdown
Based on memory-bank/productContext.md and the validated architecture,
create docs/backlog/PRJ-003-backlog-initial.md with:

- The identified Epics (functional groupings)
- The User Stories of each Epic (standard format)
- The MoSCoW prioritization (Must/Should/Could/Won't)
- The dependencies between User Stories
- The complexity estimate (T-shirt sizing: XS/S/M/L/XL)

Update memory-bank/productContext.md with the structured backlog.
Commit with: 'feat(backlog): structured initial backlog with MoSCoW prioritization'
```

*-> Artifact produced: `docs/backlog/PRJ-003-backlog-initial.md`*

## 8. Agentic Anti-Risk Mechanisms

### 8.1 Agentic Risk Catalog

Agentic development presents specific risks absent from classical human development. This catalog identifies them and describes the countermeasures integrated into the workbench.

| Risk ID | Risk | Probability | Impact | Main Countermeasure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RA-001** | Context loss between sessions | VERY HIGH | CRITICAL | Memory Bank + CHECK->CREATE->READ->ACT sequence |
| **RA-002** | Code hallucination | HIGH | CRITICAL | Temperature 0.15 + deterministic Modelfile |
| **RA-003** | Architecture drift over several months | HIGH | HIGH | `systemPatterns.md` + ADRs in `decisionLog.md` |
| **RA-004** | Inconsistency across long sessions | HIGH | HIGH | `activeContext.md` updated every session |
| **RA-005** | Silent regression | MEDIUM | CRITICAL | Mandatory QA tests + versioned reports |
| **RA-006** | Loss of product vision | MEDIUM | HIGH | `projectBrief.md` immutable unless explicit decision |
| **RA-007** | Undetected code duplication | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | `systemPatterns.md` + Developer review |
| **RA-008** | Untraced architecture decisions | HIGH | HIGH | `decisionLog.md` + RULE 2 `.clinerules` |
| **RA-009** | Prompt injection / behavioral drift | LOW | CRITICAL | `.clinerules` + RBAC `.roomodes` |
| **RA-010** | Working on wrong code version | MEDIUM | HIGH | Mandatory Git + frequent commits |

---

### 8.2 RA-001 - Context Loss Between Sessions

**Risk description:** An LLM has no memory between two sessions. Without an explicit mechanism, each session starts from scratch. On a multi-month project, this leads to inconsistencies, re-implementations, contradictions.

**Integrated countermeasures:**

```
LEVEL 1 - Mandatory startup sequence (RULE 1 .clinerules)
  The agent MUST read activeContext.md and progress.md before any action
  If the files do not exist, it creates them from the templates

LEVEL 2 - Mandatory update at closure (RULE 2 .clinerules)
  The agent MUST update activeContext.md before attempt_completion
  activeContext.md contains: current task, last result, next action

LEVEL 3 - Thematic context according to the task (RULE 3 .clinerules)
  Before architecture modification: read systemPatterns.md
  Before build/test commands: read techContext.md
  At sprint start: read productContext.md

LEVEL 4 - Redundancy in roleDefinitions (.roomodes)
  The Developer has the READ->CODE->UPDATE->COMMIT protocol inscribed
  in its roleDefinition - even if .clinerules is not read
```

**Resume protocol after long interruption (> 1 week):**

> **PROMPT RA-001 -- Resume after interruption**
> **Required Roo Code mode:** `scrum-master`
> **Complexity:** Simple -- 1 send, replace [X] with the number of days of interruption
> **Copy-paste the block below as-is, then replace [X]:**

```markdown
I am resuming the project after [X] days of interruption.
Read in this order:
1. memory-bank/activeContext.md
2. memory-bank/progress.md
3. memory-bank/projectBrief.md
4. memory-bank/productContext.md

Then generate a project status summary:
- Where are we?
- What was the last task in progress?
- What are the next actions?
- Are there any identified blockers?

Update activeContext.md with the resume date.
Commit with: 'docs(memory): project resume after [X] days - [DATE]'
```

---

### 8.3 RA-002 - Code Hallucination

**Risk description:** An LLM can generate syntactically correct but functionally wrong code, invent non-existent APIs, or produce implementations that seem plausible but do not work.

**Integrated countermeasures:**

```
LEVEL 1 - Determinism parameters (Ollama Modelfile)
  temperature 0.15 (quasi-deterministic)
  min_p 0.03, top_p 0.95, repeat_penalty 1.1
  Drastically reduces "creative" unfounded responses

LEVEL 2 - Mandatory QA tests after each US
  The QA Engineer runs real tests (not simulated)
  Acceptance criteria are verified one by one
  Bugs are documented in SPR-[NNN]-004

LEVEL 3 - Frequent commits with descriptive messages
  Each sub-task is committed separately
  If hallucination detected: git revert to the last clean commit

LEVEL 4 - Memory Bank reading before coding
  systemPatterns.md contains the REAL patterns of the project
  techContext.md contains the REAL tested commands
  The agent codes in coherence with what exists, not what it imagines
```

**Detecting a hallucination:**

```
Warning signs:
- The agent imports a library not in requirements.txt
- The agent calls a function that does not exist in the code
- The agent describes an architecture different from systemPatterns.md
- QA tests systematically fail on a US

Corrective action:
1. git log --oneline -10  (identify the last clean commit)
2. git diff HEAD~1        (see what changed)
3. git revert [hash]      (roll back if necessary)
4. Update activeContext.md with the problem description
5. Relaunch the Developer with more precise context
```

---

### 8.4 RA-003 - Architectural Drift Over Several Months

**Risk description:** On a long project, architecture decisions made in Phase 1 can be forgotten or contradicted by later decisions. Without traceability, the code becomes inconsistent.

**Integrated countermeasures:**

```
LEVEL 1 - decisionLog.md as ADR registry
  Each architecture decision is documented with:
  Date, context, decision made, consequences
  Format: ADR-[NNN] with sequential numbering

LEVEL 2 - systemPatterns.md as living reference
  Updated after each architecture decision
  Contains the CURRENT patterns (not the initial patterns)
  The agent reads this file before any architectural modification

LEVEL 3 - RULE 2 .clinerules
  If an architecture decision is made during the session:
  MANDATORY update of memory-bank/decisionLog.md

LEVEL 4 - Architectural review in Sprint Review
  The Product Owner verifies consistency with the initial vision
  Drifts are identified and documented
```

**Architectural review protocol (every 3 sprints):**

> **PROMPT RA-003 -- Architectural review**
> **Required Roo Code mode:** `developer`
> **Complexity:** Simple -- 1 send, replace [NNN] with the current sprint number
> **Copy-paste the block below as-is, then replace [NNN]:**

```markdown
Read memory-bank/systemPatterns.md, memory-bank/decisionLog.md
and docs/architecture/PRJ-002-architecture-initiale.md.

Compare the initial architecture with the current architecture.
Identify:
- Drifts from the initial architecture
- Implicit decisions not documented in decisionLog.md

### 8.5 RA-004 - Inconsistency Across Long Sessions (Multi-Month)

**Risk description:** On a multi-month project with dozens of sessions, the information in the Memory Bank can become obsolete, contradictory or incomplete.

**Integrated countermeasures:**

```
LEVEL 1 - activeContext.md as "working memory"
  Updated at EVERY session (start and end)
  Always contains the most recent state
  Includes the hash of the last Git commit

LEVEL 2 - progress.md as "dashboard"
  Checklist of phases and features
  Updated at each end of sprint
  Allows seeing at a glance where the project stands

LEVEL 3 - Git versioning of the Memory Bank
  git log --oneline -- memory-bank/ shows the complete history
  In case of doubt: git show [hash]:memory-bank/activeContext.md

LEVEL 4 - Periodic consistency audit (monthly)
```

**Memory Bank consistency audit protocol (monthly):**

> **PROMPT RA-004 -- Memory Bank consistency audit**
> **Required Roo Code mode:** `scrum-master`
> **Complexity:** Sequential -- the agent checks each file and corrects inconsistencies
> **Copy-paste the block below as-is:**

```markdown
Perform a Memory Bank consistency audit.

For each file, verify:
1. projectBrief.md: Is the vision still valid?
2. productContext.md: Is the backlog up to date with the delivered sprints?
3. systemPatterns.md: Do the patterns match the current code?
4. techContext.md: Are the commands and versions up to date?
5. activeContext.md: Does the described state match the Git reality?
6. progress.md: Do the checked boxes match the commits?
7. decisionLog.md: Are all recent decisions documented?

For each inconsistency found, correct the relevant file.
Commit with: 'docs(memory): monthly consistency audit [DATE]'
```

### 8.6 RA-005 - Silent Regression

**Risk description:** A Developer modification can break an existing feature without anyone detecting it, especially if tests do not cover all features.

**Integrated countermeasures:**

```
LEVEL 1 - Mandatory QA tests after each US
  The QA Engineer tests not only the new US
  But also the previous US potentially impacted

LEVEL 2 - Atomic commits
  Each US = series of related commits
  git bisect allows identifying the commit that introduced the regression

LEVEL 3 - Versioned test report
  SPR-[NNN]-004 documents the test state at each sprint
  Comparison possible between sprints to detect regressions

LEVEL 4 - Acceptance criteria in the Sprint Backlog
  Each US has precise and testable acceptance criteria
  The QA Engineer verifies each criterion individually
```

---

### 8.7 RA-008 - Untraced Architecture Decisions

**Risk description:** The agent makes implicit architecture decisions (library choice, implementation pattern) without documenting them. These decisions are lost between sessions.

**Integrated countermeasures:**

```
LEVEL 1 - RULE 2 .clinerules (mandatory)
  If an architecture decision was made during the session:
  MANDATORY update of memory-bank/decisionLog.md

LEVEL 2 - Standardized ADR format
  Each ADR contains: Date, Context, Decision, Consequences
  Sequential numbering: ADR-001, ADR-002, ...

LEVEL 3 - Proactive detection by the Developer
  Before choosing a library: check decisionLog.md
  If a similar decision exists: respect it or revise it explicitly
```

**Standard ADR format:**

```markdown
## ADR-[NNN]: [Decision title]
**Date:** [DATE]
**Status:** Proposed / Accepted / Deprecated / Replaced by ADR-[YYY]

**Context:**
[Why this decision was necessary]

**Decision:**
[What was decided]

**Consequences:**
- Advantage: [Description]
- Disadvantage: [Description]
- Impact on: [Relevant files/modules]
```

### 8.8 Anti-Risk Summary Table

| Risk | Preventive Mechanism | Detective Mechanism | Corrective Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| RA-001 Context loss | Memory Bank + RULE 1 | CHECK->CREATE->READ sequence | Long interruption resume protocol |
| RA-002 Hallucination | T=0.15 + Modelfile | QA tests + git diff | git revert + relaunch with precise context |
| RA-003 Arch drift | decisionLog.md + RULE 2 | Arch review every 3 sprints | ARCH-REVIEW + ADR update |
| RA-004 Multi-month inconsistency | activeContext.md every session | Monthly Memory Bank audit | Correction + docs(memory) commit |
| RA-005 Regression | Mandatory QA tests | SPR-[NNN]-004 compares to previous | git bisect + fix + re-test |
| RA-008 Untraced ADRs | RULE 2 .clinerules | decisionLog.md audit | Retro-documentation of decisions |

## 9. Session Protocols

### 9.1 Session Startup Protocol

**Applicable to all sessions, all modes, all personas.**

```
STEP 1 - VERIFICATION (automatic via .clinerules RULE 1)
  The agent verifies the existence of:
  - memory-bank/activeContext.md
  - memory-bank/progress.md

STEP 2 - CREATION if absent
  If one of the files is absent:
  The agent creates it from the template defined in .clinerules
  Then moves to step 3

STEP 3 - READING
  The agent reads in this order:
  1. memory-bank/activeContext.md  (current state)
  2. memory-bank/progress.md       (global progress)

STEP 4 - CONTEXTUAL READING (according to the task)
  If architecture modification planned: read systemPatterns.md
  If build/test commands planned: read techContext.md
  If sprint start: read productContext.md

STEP 5 - ACTION
  The agent processes the user's request
```

> **PROMPT 9.1 -- Session startup (context instruction)**
> **Required Roo Code mode:** `[the mode appropriate to the task]`
> **Complexity:** Simple -- to add at the beginning of any prompt to force context reading
> **Copy-paste this prefix before your request:**

```markdown
Before acting, read memory-bank/activeContext.md and
memory-bank/progress.md to get back into the project context.

[Describe here the task to accomplish]
```

---

### 9.2 Session Closure Protocol

**Applicable before any `attempt_completion`, all modes, all personas.**

```
STEP 1 - UPDATE activeContext.md (mandatory)
  Content to update:
  - Update date
  - Task accomplished during this session
  - Current project state
  - Recommended next action(s)
  - Possible blockers
  - Hash of the last Git commit

STEP 2 - UPDATE progress.md (if features completed)
  Check off the US or phases completed during the session

STEP 3 - UPDATE decisionLog.md (if architecture decision)
  Document any architecture decision made during the session
  Standard ADR format (see section 8.7)

STEP 4 - GIT COMMIT (mandatory)
  git add .
  git commit -m "docs(memory): [session description]"
  The hash of this commit must be noted in activeContext.md
```

---

### 9.3 Resume Protocol After Interruption

**Use this protocol after any interruption > 1 week.**

> **PROMPT 9.3 -- Resume after long interruption**
> **Required Roo Code mode:** `scrum-master`
> **Complexity:** Simple -- 1 send, replace [X] and [DATE]
> **Copy-paste the block below as-is, then replace [X] and [DATE]:**

```markdown
I am resuming the project after [X] days/weeks of interruption.

Perform a resume assessment:

1. Read memory-bank/activeContext.md
   -> What was the last task in progress?
   -> What was the project state?

2. Read memory-bank/progress.md
   -> Which phases/features are completed?
   -> Which are in progress?

3. Run: git log --oneline -10
   -> What are the last commits?
   -> Are there commits not documented in the Memory Bank?

4. Read memory-bank/projectBrief.md
   -> Is the project vision still valid?

5. Generate a resume report in docs/sprints/REPRISE-[DATE].md:
   - Project state at the time of resumption
   - Recommended next actions
   - Risks identified after the interruption

6. Update memory-bank/activeContext.md with the resume date.
7. Commit with: 'docs(memory): project resume after [X] days - [DATE]'
```

---

### 9.4 LLM Backend Switch Protocol

**Use this protocol when switching between the 3 LLM modes.**

```
BEFORE SWITCHING:
  1. Commit the current Memory Bank state
     git add memory-bank/
     git commit -m "docs(memory): save before LLM backend switch"

  2. Note the new backend in activeContext.md
     "Active LLM backend: [Ollama uadf-agent | Proxy Gemini | Claude Sonnet API]"

AFTER SWITCHING:
  3. Test the new backend with a simple request
     "Read memory-bank/activeContext.md and summarize the project state."

  4. Verify that the Memory Bank is correctly read
     The summary must match the actual content of the files

WHY THIS PROTOCOL:
  Each LLM backend has different characteristics:
  - Ollama (local): deterministic, may be slower on complex tasks
  - Proxy Gemini: high quality, requires human copy-paste
  - Claude API: high quality, fully automatic, paid
  The Memory Bank guarantees context continuity regardless of the backend.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS OF PROXY GEMINI MODE (to document in activeContext.md):
  - Boomerang Tasks (new_task): NOT SUPPORTED -- use Claude API for tasks
    requiring sub-agents
  - Long tasks (> 10 LLM turns): NOT RECOMMENDED -- split into sub-tasks or
    use Claude API
  - Parallel clipboard use: IMPOSSIBLE during a proxy session
  - Unsupervised execution: IMPOSSIBLE -- continuous human presence required
  - Gemini conversation: ALWAYS use a NEW conversation each session
    (do not continue an existing conversation -- the proxy already sends the full history)
```

> **KNOWN LIMITATIONS OF PROXY GEMINI MODE** (to document in `activeContext.md` when switching):
>
> | Limitation | Detail | Alternative |
> | :--- | :--- | :--- |
> | **Boomerang Tasks (`new_task`): NOT SUPPORTED** | Two concurrent Roo Code instances share the same clipboard -> immediate deadlock | Use Local Mode (Ollama on `calypso`) or Cloud Mode (Claude API) |
> | **Long tasks (> 10 LLM turns): NOT RECOMMENDED** | Clipboard size explodes, human cognitive fatigue | Split into sub-tasks of < 10 turns, or use Claude API |
> | **Parallel clipboard use: IMPOSSIBLE** | Any Ctrl+C during a proxy session overwrites the Gemini response waiting | Do not use the clipboard for anything else during a session |
> | **Unsupervised execution: IMPOSSIBLE** | Continuous human presence required at each LLM turn | Use Local Mode (Ollama on `calypso`) or Cloud Mode (Claude API) |
> | **Gemini conversation: ALWAYS new conversation** | The proxy already sends the full history in the clipboard -- continuing an existing conversation duplicates the history | Open a new Gemini conversation each proxy session |

> **PROMPT 9.4 -- LLM backend switch test**
> **Required Roo Code mode:** `scrum-master`
> **Complexity:** Simple -- 1 send to verify that the new backend reads the Memory Bank correctly
> **Copy-paste the block below as-is:**

```markdown
Read memory-bank/activeContext.md and summarize in 5 points:
1. The current project
2. The last accomplished task
3. The current state
4. The next actions
5. Any blockers
```

---

### 9.4.1 Task Splitting Strategy in Proxy Mode

> **Golden rule of Proxy Mode:** Keep each task under **10 LLM turns** (10 clipboard round-trips). Beyond that, the clipboard size explodes and human cognitive fatigue degrades quality.

#### Why split?

In Proxy Gemini Mode, each LLM turn represents:
- **~30 to 60 seconds** of active human attention (copy-paste)
- **Clipboard growth**: the full history is sent at each turn
- **An increasing risk of human error** with fatigue

A 20-turn task = ~15-20 minutes of continuous attention + risk of clipboard corruption.

#### Splitting rules

| Task size | Estimated LLM turns | Verdict | Action |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| Simple task (1 file, 1 action) | 1-3 | Ideal | Launch directly |
| Medium task (2-3 files, simple logic) | 4-7 | Acceptable | Launch directly |
| Complex task (architecture, multi-file) | 8-10 | Limit | Split if possible |
| Long task (complete US, refactoring) | 10-20 | Too long | **Split mandatory** |
| Very long task (full sprint, migration) | 20+ | Impossible | Use Claude API |

#### How to split a long task

**Principle:** Identify **intermediate delivery points** -- stable states where the code works and can be committed.

```
LONG TASK: "Implement User Story US-042 (JWT authentication)"
  Estimated at 15-20 LLM turns

SPLIT INTO PROXY SUB-TASKS:

  Sub-task A (3-4 turns):
  "Create the User model and database migrations.
   Commit when done."

  Sub-task B (3-4 turns):
  "Implement the POST /auth/login endpoint with JWT generation.
   Use the User model created previously. Commit."

  Sub-task C (3-4 turns):
  "Implement the JWT verification middleware for protected routes.
   Commit."

  Sub-task D (2-3 turns):
  "Write unit tests for the 3 previous components. Commit."
```

#### Warning signals during a proxy session

If you observe any of these signals, **finish the current sub-task and start a new session**:

- The clipboard contains > 30,000 characters (verifiable in the proxy console)
- You have performed > 8 clipboard round-trips
- The Gemini response starts to be truncated or incoherent
- You are having trouble following what the agent is doing
- You accidentally used the clipboard for something else

#### Sub-task closure protocol

Before finishing a sub-task and starting a new one:

```
1. Ask the agent to commit the current state:
   "Commit everything that has been done with a descriptive message."

2. Ask the agent to update activeContext.md:
   "Update memory-bank/activeContext.md with the current state
    and the next sub-task to do."

3. Commit the Memory Bank:
   "git add memory-bank/ && git commit -m 'docs(memory): intermediate state [description]'"

4. Open a new Roo Code session (new Gemini conversation)
   and resume with the next sub-task.
```

> **PROMPT 9.4.1 -- Long task splitting**
> **Required Roo Code mode:** `scrum-master`
> **Complexity:** Simple -- 1 send to get a splitting plan before starting
> **Copy-paste the block below as-is, then replace [TASK DESCRIPTION]:**

```markdown
I am going to use Proxy Gemini Mode for the following task:
[TASK DESCRIPTION]

Before starting, decompose this task into sub-tasks of maximum 5 LLM turns each.
For each sub-task:
- Describe what needs to be done
- Identify the intermediate delivery point (committable state)
- Estimate the number of LLM turns needed

Present the plan as a numbered list.
I will launch each sub-task in a separate proxy session.
```

### 9.5 Git Conflict Resolution Protocol

**Use this protocol if Git conflicts appear (rare but possible).**

> **PROMPT 9.5 -- Git conflict resolution**
> **Required Roo Code mode:** `developer`
> **Complexity:** Iterative -- the agent identifies conflicts and proposes resolutions
> **Copy-paste the block below as-is:**

```markdown
A Git conflict has been detected.

1. Run: git status
   -> Identify the conflicting files

2. For each conflicting file:
   - If conflict in memory-bank/: favor the most recent version
   - If conflict in src/: analyze both versions and choose the best
   - If conflict in docs/: merge both versions if possible

3. After resolution:
   git add [resolved files]
   git commit -m 'fix(git): conflict resolution [description]'

4. Update memory-bank/activeContext.md with the conflict description
   and its resolution.
```

---

### 9.6 Agent Error Handling Protocol

**Use this protocol if the agent produces incorrect or incoherent results.**

```
DIAGNOSIS:
  1. Identify the error type:
     - Hallucination (invented code, non-existent API)
     - Inconsistency with Memory Bank (ignores conventions)
     - Context overflow (forgets the beginning of the conversation)
     - RBAC permission error (attempts an out-of-scope action)
     - Proxy timeout (HTTP 408 -- no response copied within the deadline)

CORRECTION BY TYPE:

  Hallucination:
  -> git revert [last problematic commit]
  -> Relaunch with more precise context and concrete examples
  -> Verify that systemPatterns.md and techContext.md are up to date

  Inconsistency with Memory Bank:
  -> Verify that .clinerules is at the project root
  -> Reload VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+P > "Developer: Reload Window")
  -> Relaunch explicitly reminding to read the Memory Bank

  Context overflow:
  -> Start a new Roo Code session
  -> The new session will re-read the Memory Bank from the start
  -> That is why the Memory Bank must be up to date before each closure

  RBAC error:
  -> Verify that the correct persona is selected in Roo Code
  -> Verify that .roomodes is at the project root
  -> If the persona attempts an out-of-scope action, it must refuse
     and suggest the appropriate persona

  Proxy timeout (HTTP 408):
  -> Observed Roo Code behavior: Roo Code receives an HTTP 408 error
     and displays an error message in the interface ("Request Timeout" or
     "Error communicating with the API"). It does NOT perform automatic retry
     -- the current task is interrupted and the agent waits for a new instruction.
  -> Cause: The human did not copy the Gemini response within the TIMEOUT_SECONDS
     deadline (default: 300s), or used the clipboard for something else while waiting.
  -> Corrective action:
     1. Check in the proxy console the number of the expired request (#N)
     2. Return to Gemini and copy the response if still available
        (Ctrl+A then Ctrl+C on the Gemini response)
     3. If the Gemini response is no longer available: relaunch the same request
        in Roo Code -- the proxy will send a new prompt to Gemini
     4. If timeouts are frequent: increase TIMEOUT_SECONDS in proxy.py
        (e.g.: TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 600 for 10 minutes)
  -> Prevention: Never use the clipboard for anything else while
     a proxy request is waiting (see limitations section 9.4).
```

| The agent hallucinates code | Insufficient context, temperature too high | Read `systemPatterns.md` + `techContext.md` before coding |
| Tests systematically fail | Regression introduced, hallucination | `git bisect` to identify the faulty commit, `git revert` |
| Velocity drops by > 30% | Underestimated complexity, impediments | Immediate retrospective, revise estimates |
| `activeContext.md` is > 48h old | Sessions without Memory Bank update | Memory Bank audit (protocol 9.3) |
| Frequent Git conflicts | Multiple parallel sessions | Always commit before switching sessions |
| Critical bugs accumulate | Insufficient tests, US too broad | Split US, strengthen acceptance criteria |
| Architecture drifts | Undocumented ADRs, obsolete Memory Bank | Architectural review (protocol RA-003) |

## Appendix B - Process Glossary

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Artifact** | Document produced by the Agile process. Each artifact has a unique ID, a template, a responsible persona and a defined location in the project structure. |
| **Open Upstream** | Phase 0 of the process. Accepts unstructured inputs (emails, notes, existing code) and progressively transforms them into structured artifacts via BRIEF-001, BRIEF-002, BRIEF-003. |
| **Progressive Convergence** | Principle by which raw narrative inputs (Phase 0) mature toward increasingly structured artifacts (Phase 1, Phase 2) without forcing a premature structure. |
| **Defense in Depth** | Agentic security principle: each critical rule is inscribed at multiple levels (`.clinerules`, `roleDefinition`, session protocols) so that it is respected even if one level is ignored. |
| **Epic** | Functional grouping of User Stories sharing a common business objective. An Epic can span multiple sprints. |
| **Hallucination** | Behavior of an LLM that generates plausible but incorrect content (invented code, non-existent API, fictional architecture). Main countermeasure: temperature 0.15 + mandatory QA tests. |
| **Impediment** | Obstacle that prevents the team from progressing. Identified by the Scrum Master in the Retrospective. Must have a documented resolution plan. |
| **MoSCoW** | Prioritization method: Must (mandatory), Should (important), Could (desirable), Won't (out of scope). Used for the initial backlog (PRJ-003). |
| **Context Loss** | Agentic risk RA-001. An LLM has no memory between two sessions. The Memory Bank is the main countermeasure mechanism. |
| **Session Protocol** | Sequence of mandatory actions at the start and closure of each Roo Code session. Guarantees context continuity between sessions. |
| **Silent Regression** | Bug introduced by a modification that breaks an existing feature without being immediately detected. Countermeasure: QA tests after each US. |
| **Sprint Goal** | One-sentence sprint objective. Defines what the team commits to deliver. Written in SPR-NNN-001 and in `activeContext.md`. |
| **T-shirt Sizing** | Complexity estimation method: XS (< 1h), S (1-4h), M (4-8h), L (1-3d), XL (> 3d). Used for the initial backlog. |
| **User Story** | Description of a feature from the user's perspective. Format: "As a [persona], I want [action] so that [benefit]". Identified by US-NNN. |
| **Velocity** | Number of points delivered per sprint. Indicator of team capacity. Calculated in SPR-NNN-005. |
