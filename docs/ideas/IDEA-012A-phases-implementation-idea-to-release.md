## Description

PHASE-A of the Ideation-to-Release governance process implementation. Foundation layer: creates the essential files and rules that enable the full process to function.

This is a meta-implementation — we are implementing the process that will govern all future ideas.

## Motivation

The governance model for the Agentic Agile Workbench needed extension to handle:
1. Continuous, asynchronous arrival of ideas during active development
2. Multiple parallel ideas at different maturity levels simultaneously  
3. Real-time conflict detection between ideas in parallel development
4. Technical suggestions routing (tech_parking_lot concept)
5. A dedicated Intake Agent that greets every human input
6. Live execution tracking in DOC-3 at all times

## Affected Documents

- `.clinerules`: RULE 11, 12, 13 added (Intake, Sync, Execution Tracking)
- `docs/ideas/TECH-SUGGESTIONS-BACKLOG.md`: New file created
- `docs/releases/v2.4/DOC-3-v2.4-Implementation-Plan.md`: Execution tracking chapter structure added
- `template/.clinerules`: RULE 11, 12, 13 added (for new projects)
- `template/docs/ideas/`: TECH-SUGGESTIONS-BACKLOG.md added

## Implementation Details

### PHASE-A Deliverables

| # | Deliverable | Status |
|---|-------------|--------|
| 1 | `docs/ideas/TECH-SUGGESTIONS-BACKLOG.md` created | ✅ |
| 2 | RULE 11 (Ideation Intake) added to `.clinerules` | ✅ |
| 3 | RULE 12 (Synchronization Awareness) added to `.clinerules` | ✅ |
| 4 | RULE 13 (DOC-3 Execution Chapter) added to `.clinerules` | ✅ |
| 5 | DOC-3 execution tracking chapter structure added to v2.4 plan | ✅ |
| 6 | `template/.clinerules` updated with PHASE-A rules | ✅ |
| 7 | `template/docs/ideas/TECH-SUGGESTIONS-BACKLOG.md` created | ✅ |

### Branch

`feature/IDEA-012A-phases-implementation` from `develop`

### Verification

- [ ] `docs/ideas/TECH-SUGGESTIONS-BACKLOG.md` exists and is valid markdown
- [ ] `.clinerules` contains RULE 11, 12, 13
- [ ] `template/.clinerules` contains RULE 11, 12, 13
- [ ] DOC-3 v2.4 has execution tracking chapter template
- [ ] All Python files pass syntax check

## Dependencies

None — PHASE-A has no dependencies.

## Disposition

**Decision:** ACCEPTED — Human approved at 2026-03-30 session
**Implementation:** Immediate — switch to Developer mode after creation
