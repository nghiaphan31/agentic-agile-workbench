# Ideas Backlog

**Last triage:** 2026-03-28
**Next triage:** At v2.0 release planning (before PHASE-A)

## How to Use

- Add new ideas immediately when they arise — never inject them directly into canonical docs.
- Create a corresponding `IDEA-NNN.md` file with full details.
- Status is updated at triage sessions (before each release starts and after each release is tagged).

## Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[IDEA]` | Captured, not yet evaluated |
| `[ACCEPTED]` | Approved for a specific release |
| `[IMPLEMENTED]` | Built, tested, in a released version |
| `[DEFERRED]` | Good idea, but not this release |
| `[REJECTED]` | Will never be implemented (reason documented) |
| `[SUPERSEDED]` | Replaced by a better idea |
