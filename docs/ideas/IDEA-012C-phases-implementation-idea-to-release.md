## Description

PHASE-C of the Ideation-to-Release governance process implementation. Full features layer: implements the complete synchronization detection system, branch tracker, dashboard/CLI, and tool-assisted DOC-3 execution chapter generation.

## Motivation

PHASE-C completes the full vision:
1. Full SyncDetector with git-diff + semantic analysis
2. BranchTracker class for active branch monitoring
3. Dashboard/CLI for viewing sync status
4. Tool-assisted DOC-3 execution chapter generation (AI drafts, human approves)

## Affected Documents

- `src/calypso/sync_detector.py`: Enhanced with full git-diff + semantic analysis
- `src/calypso/branch_tracker.py`: New file — active branch monitoring
- `src/calypso/execution_tracker.py`: New file — tool-assisted DOC-3 generation
- `src/calypso/intake_agent.py`: Enhanced intake processing
- DOC-3 v2.5 execution chapter: Auto-generated skeleton with human verification

## Implementation Details

### PHASE-C Deliverables

| # | Deliverable | Status |
|---|-------------|--------|
| 1 | `src/calypso/sync_detector.py` — full implementation (git-diff + semantic) | ⏳ |
| 2 | `src/calypso/branch_tracker.py` — active branch monitoring | ⏳ |
| 3 | `src/calypso/execution_tracker.py` — tool-assisted DOC-3 generation | ⏳ |
| 4 | `src/calypso/intake_agent.py` — enhanced intake (complexity scoring) | ⏳ |
| 5 | Dashboard/CLI for sync status viewing | ⏳ |
| 6 | DOC-3 execution chapter auto-generation script | ⏳ |
| 7 | Integration tests for full pipeline | ⏳ |

### Complexity Score

**Score: 9/10** (High)
- Complex git operations (diff analysis, branch comparison)
- Semantic similarity algorithms
- CLI/dashboard implementation
- AI-assisted document generation

### Branch

`feature/IDEA-012C-phases-implementation` from `develop`

## Dependencies

- IDEA-012B must be IMPLEMENTED first

## Pre-requisites

- PHASE-A and PHASE-B complete and merged to develop
- SyncDetector basic version working
- Refinement workflow functional

## Tool-Assisted Execution Tracking

Per Human decision: "Tool-assisted — AI generates draft, human reviews and approves before commit"

The execution tracker will:
1. Parse git log and branch status to generate draft
2. Compare against progress.md for consistency
3. Present draft to human for review and annotation
4. Human approves before commit to DOC-3

## Disposition

**Decision:** ACCEPTED — Part of Option B (live-test process)
**Planned:** v2.5 release, after IDEA-012B merged

## Verification

- [ ] All new Python files pass syntax check
- [ ] Full sync detection (git-diff + semantic) works correctly
- [ ] BranchTracker correctly monitors all active branches
- [ ] Execution tracker generates accurate DOC-3 drafts
- [ ] Human approves DOC-3 updates before commit

## History

- 2026-03-30: Created by Architect mode — Part of three-phase implementation
- 2026-03-30: Approved by Human — Option B (live-test process)
- 2026-03-30: Planned for implementation after IDEA-012B
